Pi-Light-Sensor
===============

RaspberryPiLightSensor

The idea is to create a solution to react to a biscuit tin being opened. 
The hardware plan and some of the code is from the Adafruit website at http://learn.adafruit.com/basic-resistor-sensor-reading-on-raspberry-pi/basic-photocell-reading
I've extended it to include some conditional code based on the feedback from the GPIO pin.
This iteration (2014-01-26) just shines the LEDs but the eventual goal is to update a spreadsheet to use with the dashing.io dashboard or maybe just send a tweet to an account
